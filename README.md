# python-tools

Misc Python tools. This is probably useless, but use them as you want, released under WTFPL 2.

 * `thblt.data` : a few stupid tools for dealing with some data types.
 * `thblt.events` : a rudimentary and buggy event manager, just copied-and-pasted from a code where it has been removed
 * `thblt.filesystem` : mostly a FSWatcher class which tracks a folder and report changes.
 * `thblt.qt` : tools for PyQt. Not much.
 * `thblt.system` : dealing with system problems. Includes an unfinished, but agressive and probably somehow efficient, method for getting the current user's locale.
